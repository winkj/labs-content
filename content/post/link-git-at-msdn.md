> "[...] the Windows code base is approximately 3.5M files and, when checked in to a Git repo, results in a repo of about 300GB.  Further, the Windows team is about 4,000 engineers and the engineering system produces 1,760 daily “lab builds” across 440 branches in addition to thousands of pull request validation builds"
