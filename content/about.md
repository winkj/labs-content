## Johannes Winkelmann - Bio

Born in Switzerland, I've been in San Francisco, California for a few years now.
In my spare time, I enjoy [taking pictures](https://500px.com/johanneswinkelmann),
playing ice hockey, and spending time with my wife and our awesome cat
Charlie<i class="fa fa-paw" aria-hidden="true"></i>.


I work as a Technology Evangelist for [Sensirion](http://www.sensirion.com), a
sensor manufacturer building environmental sensors to measure humidity,
temperature, air quality, differential pressure and air and liquid flow rates.
As part of this role, I started our SF/Silicon Valley office, manage
relationships with platform partners and represent the company at trade shows
and conferences. I also get to give talks on our technology at events. Most
recently, I was in charge of creating our developer portal at
<http://developer.sensirion.com>, and provided tutorials and sample code for it.

Before that, I was the first software engineer on Sensirion's mobile team, and
was involved in supporting a very large Korea mobile phone OEM in integrating
our sensor technology. I also wrote the Linux driver for the SHTC1/SHTW2
humidity temperature sensors which has since been merged to the upstream
[Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org).

Before joining Sensirion, I worked at a home automation startup in Switzerland
called [Digitalstrom](https://www.digitalstrom.org/en/) where I was working on
the embedded server component, an embedded linux system. I also represented the
company at their Developer Days, presenting our technology to customers and users.

Prior to that, I worked in a internet radio and networked audio startup called BridgeCo
which was [acquired](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110519006895/en/SMSC-Acquires-BridgeCo)
by SMSC, which got [bought](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1264469) by Microchip.
I was working on making our soundcards compatible with the USB Audio 2.0 class
as well as writing Linux kernel drivers for BridgeCo's fourth generation
internet radio platform.

Before joining BridgeCo, I was a research assistant at the [Wearable Computing Lab](www.ife.ee.ethz.ch/
) at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch), and also a research assistant at the
[Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](www.memcenter.unibe.ch).
